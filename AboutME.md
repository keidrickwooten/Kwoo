# Keidrick Wooten
Hello all, my name is Keidrick Wooten. I am a senior at Lyon college, I play football at the school as well. On top of all of that I am also the General Manager at the local Popeyes. 
I am interested in coding because computer langauges are the langauges of the future. I want to be able to help further human development and computer development in order to make life easier and more enjoyable.
